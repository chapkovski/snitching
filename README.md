# a study on Snitching and cooperation by 
### by Valeria Maggian (UniVe), Luca Corazzini (UniVe) and Philipp Chapkovski (HSE-Moscow)

There is a game with four possible treatments: 
2X2 Factors design:
- No Info vs. Info treatments. 

**Info**: participants are informed about Stage 
2 of the game  _before_ Stage 1. In **No info** treatment they are informed 
right after Stage 1.

- Snitching (aka Whistleblowing) vs No Snitching treatments.
In Stage 1, each worker has an option to inform the Principal on the 
individual effort level of their co-workers.


## Stage 1
TODO: Stage 1 detailed description goes here.

## Stage 2
Stage 2 structurally coincides with Stage 1 with a few exceptions:

* Workers make decisions that affect only the payoffs of their co-workers. 
(Neither their own nor a Principal payoff is affected.)

* Principal remains a passive player for this stage of the game
(in fact principals are redirected to the end of the study/another survey/RET)
